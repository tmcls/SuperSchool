# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition.

## **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/tmcls/SuperSchool/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/tmcls/SuperSchool/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

## **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of SuperSchool will generally not be accepted.

## **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/tmcls/SuperSchool/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [Pull Requests](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)). Please make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).
